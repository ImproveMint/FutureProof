### General Areas for Improvement

- **User Interface**: Enhance the `index.html` to improve the UI/UX experience.
- **Strategy Block Builder**: Develop a drag-and-drop interface for testing and iterating trading strategies using various technical indicators.
- **Optimizations**: Optimize the bulk of the simulation code, potentially by using a language other than Python.
- **Metrics Tracking**: Continue developing the `metrics.py` class to track relevant metrics during backtests.
- **Graphing**: Improve the graphing of strategy outcomes, including visualization of trades.
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for the fundamental classes: `order`, `order_manager`, `position`, `collateral_manager`, and `account`.
- **Candle Manager**: Enhance the candle manager to:
  - Download candles from various exchanges.
  - Resample 1-minute candles to other timeframes.
- **Machine Learning**: Incorporate machine learning to allow users to create advanced trading strategies.
